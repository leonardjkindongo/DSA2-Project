# Tree Operations and Network Modeling Projects

This repository contains two distinct projects aimed at exploring data structures and algorithms through practical implementations.

---

## Project 1: Star Topology Network Modeling (Session A)

### Description
This project models a star topology computer network. It consists of:
- **ServerNode**: The central hub for brokering messages.
- **ClientNode**: Represents peripheral nodes capable of sending and receiving messages.
- **Star**: Manages the addition and removal of nodes in the network.

### Folder Structure
- **sessionA/**
  - `ServerNode.java`: Implements the central node functionalities.
  - `ClientNode.java`: Defines the behavior of the peripheral nodes.
  - `Star.java`: Manages the star topology network.
  - `Main.java`: Demonstrates network interactions and compression.

### Features
1. Add or remove client nodes in the network.
2. Send and receive messages between client nodes through the server.
3. Compress and decompress messages using a suitable compression algorithm.

### Compression Algorithm
- Algorithm: [Specify Algorithm Name, e.g., Huffman Coding]
- Justification: [Explain why this algorithm is suitable for text message compression.]

### How to Run
1. Navigate to the `sessionA/` folder.
2. Compile all `.java` files using `javac *.java`.
3. Run the program using `java Main`.

## Project 2: Tree Operations Menu (Session B)

### Description
This project implements various tree operations and structures to demonstrate core concepts in data structures and algorithms.

### Folder Structure
- **dsaSessionB/**
  - `BinarySearchTree.java`: Implements a binary search tree with basic operations.
  - `AVLTree.java`: Implements an AVL tree with balanced insertions.
  - `RedBlackTree.java`: Implements a Red-Black tree.
  - `BTree.java`: Implements a B-Tree with a search operation.
  - `Main.java`: Provides a menu-driven program to interact with the implemented trees.

### Features
1. **Binary Search Tree**:
   - Insert nodes.
   - Perform post-order traversal.
2. **AVL Tree**:
   - Insert nodes and maintain balance.
3. **Red-Black Tree**:
   - Insert nodes and display post-order traversal.
4. **B-Trees**:
   - Insert nodes and search for a key.

### How to Run
1. Navigate to the `dsaSessionB/` folder.
2. Compile all `.java` files using `javac *.java`.
3. Run the program using `java Main`.

## Additional Enhancements
### For Session A
- Visualize message transfer between nodes.
- Simulate network latency.

### For Session B
- Visual representation of tree structures.
- Add tree properties such as height and number of nodes.
- Compare trees for similarity.
