# Tree Operations and Network Modeling Projects

This repository contains two distinct projects aimed at exploring data structures and algorithms through practical implementations.

## Star Topology Network Modeling (Session A)

### Description

This project models a star topology computer network. It consists of:

- **ServerNode**: The central hub for brokering messages.
- **ClientNode**: Represents peripheral nodes capable of sending and receiving messages.
- **Star**: Manages the addition and removal of nodes in the network.

### Folder Structure

- **sessionA/**
  - `ServerNode.java`: Implements the central node functionalities.
  - `ClientNode.java`: Defines the behavior of the peripheral nodes.
  - `Star.java`: Manages the star topology network.
  - `Main.java`: Demonstrates network interactions and compression.

### How to Run

1. Navigate to the `sessionA/` folder.
2. Compile all `.java` files using `javac *.java`.
3. Run the program using `java Main`.

## Tree Operations Menu (Session B)

### Project Description

This project implements various tree operations and structures to demonstrate core concepts in data structures and algorithms.

### Directory Structure

- **dsaSessionB/**
  - `BinarySearchTree.java`: Implements a binary search tree with basic operations.
  - `AVLTree.java`: Implements an AVL tree with balanced insertions.
  - `RedBlackTree.java`: Implements a Red-Black tree.
  - `BTree.java`: Implements a B-Tree with a search operation.
  - `TreeNode`: Node class for the binary search tree.
  - `MainB.java`: Provides a menu-driven program to interact with the implemented trees.

### Features

1. **Binary Search Tree**:
   - Insert nodes.
   - Perform post-order traversal.
2. **AVL Tree**:
   - Insert nodes and maintain balance.
   - Performs and displays the Inorder, Pre-order, and Postorder traversal.
3. **Red-Black Tree**:
   - Insert nodes and display post-order traversal.
4. **B-Trees**:
   - Insert nodes and search for a key (8).

### How to Compile

1. Navigate to the `dsaSessionB/` folder.
2. Compile all `.java` files using `javac *.java`.
3. Run the program using `java MainB`.
